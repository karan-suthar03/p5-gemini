# p5-gemini

## Description
p5-gemini is a Node.js project that generates p5.js sketches using text data generated by Gemini, an AI developed by Google. It allows users to create dynamic visualizations and representations of text data using the p5.js library.

## Installation
To get started with p5-gemini, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/p5-gemini.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd p5-gemini
    ```
3. Install dependencies using npm:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
4. Enter your Gemini API key in the `package.json` file. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key:
    ```json
    "start": "GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY node index.js"
    ```
if you don't have a Gemini API key, you can sign up for one [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).


## Usage
Once you have installed the project and entered your Gemini API key, you can start generating p5.js sketches using text data generated by Gemini AI. Simply run the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
This will start the server and generate a new p5.js sketch based on the text entered by the user. The server will listen for requests on port 3000 by default. To view the generated sketch, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
This project is buggy and not fully functional. It is a work in progress.
